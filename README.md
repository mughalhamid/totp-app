TOTP : Time One Time Password

You need to develop a .Net MVC application that we will be able to deploy in our 2 existing applications. MyAccount: to activate the On Time Password, Login if TOTP is activated, ask for the code.
The code will be generated by any time of Authenticator App like Microsoft of Google after you scan the QR code.
You can create an empty web application with /myaccount and /login to emulate those applications. No design needed.

Identified tasks (need to be validated by your side)

Step 1: Install libraries:
 
Install-Package Otp.NET
Install-Package QRCoder
 
Step 2: Generate Secret Key and QR Code

Create a helper class to handle TOTP operations. This class will be responsible for generating the secret key and the QR code.

Step 3: Controller for Setup and Validation

You'll need a controller to handle TOTP setup and validation.

Step 4: Front-End for Setup and Login
 
TOTP Setup View (EnableTwoFactorAuthentication.cshtml in MyAccount)
TOTP Token Validation View (part of the login process)

Step 5: Test

Other Info, use GPT to clean and optimize the code.
